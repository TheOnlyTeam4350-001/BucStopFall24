DESIGN DOCUMENT FOR TETRIS 

Goal: Get a restart button implemented into the Tetris game using the R key.

Requirements: 
	- Present a "Press R to Restart" text after the game ended.
	- Tell if R has been press in order to restart game
	- Reset game 
		- Score
		- canvas
  		- Tetrominos
		- Game loop
	Obstacles:
		- R should not be able to be pressed during the game  
	
Implementation
	- showGameOver - One line was implemented to show the restart instructions
		- context.fillText('| Press R to Restart |', canvas.width / 2, canvas.height / 1.9); 


	- resetGame - New function implemented ( Resets the score, tetrominos, playfield, and calls the animation loop ) 
	function resetGame() {
   		 score = 0;
    		 gameOver = false;

    		// Reset the playfield (needed new playfield or old one would overlap)
    		for (let row = -2; row < 20; row++) {
        		playfield[row] = [];
        		for (let col = 0; col < 10; col++) {
            			playfield[row][col] = 0;
        		}
    		}

    		// Reset tetromino seq
    		tetrominoSequence.length = 0; 
    		tetromino = getNextTetromino();

    		// Reset score 
    		const playerScore = document.getElementById("playerScore");
    		playerScore.textContent = `Current Score: ${score}`;

    		// Start the game loop
    		rAF = requestAnimationFrame(loop);

	- Event Listener Edited ( Added a listener for the R key so that it called the resetGame once it was pressed)
		document.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
    			if (gameOver && e.which === 82) { // 'R' key to restart
        			resetGame();
        			return;
    			}

Testing
	- Games starts properly
	- Game over message shows up properly
 	- Pressing R in the game over screen
		- resets playfield 
		- resets score to O
		- new game with new tetromino sequence is displayed
